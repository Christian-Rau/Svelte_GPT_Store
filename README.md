## Overview

**Svelte_GPT_Store** is more than a Svelte assistant — it’s a **cross-stack developer companion** built to help you bridge modern frontend frameworks with best-in-class tools like **Supabase**, **Formsnap**, **Tailwind**, and **Bits UI**.

> Unlike most GPTs, this one is focused not just on isolated code – but on **how technologies fit together** in real apps.

It prioritizes:
- **Strict correctness** (based on current docs)
- **Runes-based reactivity** for Svelte 5
- **Interoperable examples** for forms, backend, and UI integration
- **Minimal, maintainable patterns** using Tailwind and unopinionated components

### 🔍 What it supports

- ✅ **Svelte 5 Runes:** `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`, `$bindable`, `$host`, `$inspect`
- ✅ **SvelteKit 2.0 Routing & Adapters:** File-based routing, SSR, CSR, form actions, and edge deployments (Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.)
- ✅ **State Management:** Explicit reactive patterns using runes, with context, stores, and snapshots
- ✅ **Forms:** Advanced form handling with:
  - 🧩 **Superforms** (typed validation + form actions)
  - 🧱 **Formsnap** (form structure with accessibility + Superforms wiring)
  - 🧼 **Bits-UI** (headless accessible UI components)
- ✅ **Supabase Integration:** Covers both SSR cookie-auth flow and client-only setup
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS:** All examples follow minimal, production-grade utility-first design

### 🧠 Summary of GPT Features

- 📚 Only uses **documented, stable APIs** – no hallucinated props, no outdated syntax
- ⚡ Helps you architect **rune-powered components** and reactive forms
- 🔌 Bridges tools like **Supabase**, **Superforms**, and **Tailwind CSS**
- 🤝 Ideal for teams working across **multiple stacks** (frontend, backend, styling)
- 🎨 Outputs lean, scalable UI examples ready for production
